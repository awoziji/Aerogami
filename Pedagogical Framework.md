# Pedagogical Framework: 

This is the conceptual framework that the pedagogy of Aerogami is based on. 

Constructivism: It is an educational philosophy which is based on the fact that we create our knowledge for ourselves as a process of our experiences, reflections, connections etc. Aerogami lessons are designed such that every new bit of knowledge is a culmination of experiencing things, reflecting on them, and then making a synthesis for the learner themselves. 

Learning is connecting. A teacher’s role is not to teach, but to help students learn 
– to connect ideas they are already familiar with so that the connections help them understand new ideas. 

The materials that are prepared for Aerogami is designed to help students connect elements they are already familiar with to make better sense of how things fly as they go through the materials.  
To connect ideas learners are already familiar with, we will start by asking questions related to course materials. 

E.g. Instead of telling learners that airplanes have engines that helps them fly, we will ask what helps cars move, and when they come to engines, we will tell them: airplanes have engines, too, but a little bit different, and then go on to explain jet engines.
