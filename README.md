An Open Education experiment teaching Aerodynamics using Paper Planes

To the scientist an aeroplane is merely a complex body moving through a fluid, and until he understands how a simple body moves he has no chance of understanding the fundamental principles of aeronautics. - G. I . Taylor "Scientific Method in Aeronautics" (1921)

The successful aeroplane, like many other pieces of mechanism, is a huge mass of compromise. -Howard T. Wright, "Aeroplanes from an Engineer's Point of View" (1912)
